# Models:
1. ⭐ `u2net` - **U^2-Net** model has the best quality processing. [More info](https://github.com/NathanUA/U-2-Net)
3. ⭐ `deeplabv3` - Model **DeepLabV3** with ResNet101 backbone. Also, this model is only intended for segmenting images with people and animals. [More info](https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_deeplabv3_resnet101/)
2.  `basnet` - **BASNet** model [More info](https://github.com/NathanUA/BASNet)
4.  `u2netp` - **small version of U^2-Net** with low quality but high processing speed. [More info](https://github.com/NathanUA/U-2-Net)
